## :wrench: **Development Tips**

- **Backend Development:**
  The backend runs with **nodemon** for automatic restarts during development.  
  To start the backend server, run:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Frontend Development:**
  The frontend uses **React**. To run the frontend in development mode, use:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
